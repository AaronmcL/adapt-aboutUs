#adapt-aboutUs

An Adapt extension that adds to the Drawer information about the sponsoring organization.
![An example of the aboutUs extension.](https://github.com/chucklorenz/adapt-aboutUs/raw/master/clip.png "example aboutUs"):

##In Progress.

It works, but not yet ready for installation through the authoring tool. Hasn't been thoroughly tested, but then again, it's not too complex.

##Issues:

- Installation requires the included fonts to be moved manually to adapt/css/fonts. (Issue #538 requests that the Adapt framework include a grunt task accomplish this.)
- Accessibility has not been addressed.

##Installation

First, be sure to install the [Adapt Command Line Interface](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-cli), then from the command line run:-

        adapt install adapt-aboutUs

##Usage
A [sample JSON](https://github.com/chucklorenz/adapt-aboutUs/blob/master/example.json) is provided which can be added to the course.json.
